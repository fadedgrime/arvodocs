# Verification Issues

Arvo Stores uses a verification bot called [RoVer](https://rover.link) to link your Roblox account with your Discord account, granting you access to our server. If you encounter any issues, please refer to the information below for possible solutions before reaching out to our support team.

## Cannot access other channels because you are not verified?
{: .text-red-300 }

If you are unable to access other channels due to not being verified, follow these steps:  
* Go to the **#verification** channel and click the **Update my roles** button.  
The bot will guide you through the process to verify and link your Roblox account.

{: .warning }
Please note that if your Roblox account is under 13, you must contact Arvo Support through our Discord server to request alternative verification using a different bot.
